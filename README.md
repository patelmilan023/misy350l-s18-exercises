# This is Milan Patel Exercise Repo

We use **this file** to practice markdown

We have tried:

1. 'git clone': this is how you come/download a Repo
2. 'git status': this shows the status of the current Repo
3. 'git add .': this stages all changes
4. 'git commit -am "commit msg"': this commits to the changes to the Repo
